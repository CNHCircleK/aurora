                        <h3>Hello CNH Circle K-er!</h3>

                        <p>
                            Awards season is upon us! As of <strong>November 18, 2016</strong>, all DCON Awards
                            Applications were
                            e-mailed to club executive board officers and Lt. Governors. This year, we are transitioning
                            to an
                            Online Awards Submissions System with the great help of District Technology Editor Joseph
                            Le. Awards season can be extremely stressful, but we hope that you have all the tools you
                            need to start early, be proactive, and put forth all that you want into these
                            applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <strong>All awards are Kiwanian judged.</strong> The awards applications serve as a
                            reflection of all of the
                            feats and obstacles you conquered this term. We hope that you go into awards feeling that
                            you did all that you possibly could, and that no matter the outcome at District Convention
                            2017, the biggest award you could have ever received is being able to conquer the Circle K
                            year with a wonderful home club. Awards provide you with the opportunity to showcase all
                            that you were able to accomplish. It allows you to reflect on the highest of highs and the
                            lowest of lows and it reminds you of how much you were able to grow and develop over the
                            course of the year. Although awards will give you sleepless nights and stress pimples, they
                            serve as a personal reflection of the growth of your club. Ultimately, we hope that these
                            applications are things you are able to look back on and be proud of for terms to come.
